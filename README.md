# credit-risk-classification
## Background
In this assignment, I was tasked in using various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. I used a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

For this assignment, I recieved no outside help. However, I did heavily rely on class recordings and class activities.
